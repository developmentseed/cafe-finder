# Cafe Finder

Cafe finder is a minimal front-end repo to fork for development exercises. It bundles a basic but well-tested build environment for javascript and SASS, as well as babel presets for [ES2015+](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-env/) and [React/JSX](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-react/).

React and React-Dom are included by default and are recommended, but the rest is up to you.

## Requirements

- Node 8.9

## Setup

```(bash)
yarn
yarn serve
```
